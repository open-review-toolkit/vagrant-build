# Open Review Toolkit Vagrant Image Build

This repository builds a Vagrant VM image used by the [Open Review Toolkit project](https://github.com/open-review-toolkit/open-review-toolkit). Starting from a base Ubuntu image, it uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to install the [required dependencies](provisioning/setup.yml) for the Open Review Toolkit project. Once an image has been built, it will be uploaded to [Hashicorp's Vagrant box repository](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/open-review-toolkit/boxes/open-review-toolkit). The Open Review Toolkit project downloads this pre-built image, rather than building it from scratch every time to ensure greater consistency.
